# Notes

## General

For each contribution, function, or any part of the code that needs documentation in the project. Follow the example format:

    /* _NAME-OF-CODE-BLOCK_
    _DESCRIPTION_

    @params:
        - add, if any (for functions)

    @fields:
        - add, if any (for structs)

    @return:
        - add, if any (for functions)

    @fixme:
        - add, if any (for bugs or issues)

    @see: add, if any (for references)

    @author: _SURNAME_
    @contributor: _SURNAME_
    */

## Part 1

- The source code must be in C.
- Compartmentalize each data structure and algorithm as one source file with a header file (if needed).
- `TESTCASE.txt` must have at least 50 (FIFTY) test expressions.
- Remember! Add documentation to your source files and header files. Make a notes file in this repository, if needed to make documentation (Part 5 of the project) easier.
